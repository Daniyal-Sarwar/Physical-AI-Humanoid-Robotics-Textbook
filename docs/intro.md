# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

> A comprehensive guide to building intelligent robotic systems using modern software frameworks and AI techniques.

## Welcome

This textbook provides a structured learning path for robotics software development, covering the essential tools and concepts needed to build modern robotic systems. Whether you're a student, researcher, or practicing engineer, this guide will help you master the foundations of physical AI.

## What You'll Learn

### 🤖 Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
Master the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework, the de facto standard for robotics middleware. Learn about nodes, topics, services, actions, and how to build modular robot applications.

### 🌐 Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation
Create high-fidelity simulations using Gazebo and Unity. Learn to model robots, simulate sensors, and test algorithms before deploying to hardware.

### ⚡ Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform
Leverage NVIDIA's Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation. Integrate with Isaac ROS for GPU-accelerated perception.

### 🧠 Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Models
Explore cutting-edge VLA models that enable robots to understand natural language instructions and generate appropriate actions.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- **Programming**: Proficiency in Python; familiarity with C++ is helpful
- **Linux**: Basic command-line skills (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended)
- **Math**: Linear algebra, calculus, and basic probability
- **Git**: Version control fundamentals

## How to Use This Book

### Sequential Learning
The modules are designed to build upon each other. We recommend following them in order, especially if you're new to robotics.

### Hands-On Exercises
Each chapter includes 3 practical exercises:
1. **Basic**: Reinforce core concepts
2. **Intermediate**: Apply knowledge to realistic scenarios  
3. **Advanced**: Challenge yourself with open-ended problems

### Code Examples
All code examples are available in the `/examples/` directory and can be downloaded from each chapter. They're tested with:
- ROS 2 Humble (LTS)
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Python 3.10+
